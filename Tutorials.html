      <h1>Tutorials</h1>
      <p>Here you will find a variety of tutorials to help you practice your Python. The tutorials are listed roughly in order of difficulty. If you already have a good basic understanding of Python as a language, the tutorial on SDSS analysis might be a useful one for you to jump into.</p>

          <h2>I know nothing about Python; Where do I start?</h2>
          <h3>A collection of starter-pack tutorials and guidelines on how to get on your feet</h3>
          <p>The following are a set of tutorials I was asked to develop to accompany the textbook with the absolute, barebones basics of Python. What you should you play around with on your first day with the language? How, even, should you install it? What programs should you use to code in it? I try to answer some of these below.

      <p>SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) is a large sample of nearby galaxies, and in addition to being a valuable tool for a variety of scientific goals (the survey has produced over 5,800 scientific papers, which in turn have been cited a staggering 245,000 times), it also provides a useful practice set on which to exercise our python chops.</p>
      <p><b>Problem Statement</b></p>
      <p>We want to first learn how to read in the fits files (data tables) storing the SDSS catalogs for 3 key measurements: Mass, Star Formation Rate (SFR), and metallicity. Once we have successfully accessed the data, we can start to look at one of the fundamental relations in galactic astronomy- Mass/Metalicity. Instructions: 
        <ul>
          <li>Load the three catalog fits files into python and access the rec.array tables.</li>
          <li> Filter the data to only include those for which entries could be properly measured, using the "AVG" column. For mass, take only those with values not equal to -1, for SFR take those with values >-99, and for metallicity take those with values >-99.9.</li>
          <li>Make plots for mass vs metallicity, one of the fundamental correlations in extragalactic astronomy. Use a 2d Histogram with 300 bins (the LogNorm() function in matplotlib will be useful for colorbar purposes). </li>
          <li>Make the same plot for Metallicity as a function of SFR and SFR as a function of mass.</li>
          <li> You should notice all three exhibit positive trends. In order to determine which trends are legitimate and which are just representing the other trends, create three sets of plots in which you take slices (say, ten bins of equal width across the sample) of mass, metallicity, and sfr, and compare the other two properties. For one of them, the relation will dissapear. What is your conclusion then about which relations are real and which are derivatives? </li>
      </ul>

              <li>Write a model function that produces a model that is a composite of three Sines, with input parameters as the three amplitudes, periods, and single (added) offset value T0.</li>
              <li> Write a Likeness function that returns a value sum((y-y_model)^2/y_unc^2)</li>
              <li>Write a prior function that checks if a set of parameters is within reasonable values for each - return 0 if yes, and -inf if not. </li>
              <li>Write an lnp function that takes a list of parameters, runs it through the prior checking function, and if it returns 0, calculate a likelihood and return that.</li>
              <li>Look up the documentation for emcee on how to set up an MCMC using these functions, and fit the ice core data. Overplot some models from your posterior distribution over your data.
